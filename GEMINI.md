this is a rollercoaster modelling program made with the aid of Github Copilot with GPT-5 mini. this makes a 3D environment to create and manipulate segments of connected bezier curves using main vertecies and one control vertex per curve segment.

hovering over a spherical vertex and clicking on it should select it. the debug HUD panel should say that there is a hit when hovering over the respective vertex
